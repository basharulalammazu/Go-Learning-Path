Welcome to **Go Learning Path**! This repository contains my journey of learning the **Go (Golang) programming language**. It includes various Go programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts and syntax.

## üìå About This Repository

This repository serves as documentation of my **Go language learning process**. The files here cover essential topics such as **variables, escape sequences, static & dynamic variables, and shortcut variable declarations**.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each file contains a Go program with explanations and examples.

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **First.go** | A basic Go program printing my personal information. |
| **Escape Sequences.go** | Demonstrates the use of escape sequences in Go. |
| **Static Variable.go** | Shows how to declare and use static variables in Go. |
| **Dynamic Variable.go** | Demonstrates dynamic variable declaration in Go. |
| **Shortcut Variable Declaration.go** | Introduces the shorthand method for variable declaration. |
